00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.360
Hello! I'm Nanami Mami, nineteen years old,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.100
and I'm a college student living
with my family in Tokyo.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.640
Kazu-kun and I dated for about a month.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.190
<b>Let's break up, okay?</b>

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.570
<b>What?</b>

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.360
Soon after we broke up, though,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.640
he showed up at the pub with a really
pretty new girlfriend in tow.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.080
We were all having a good time until
she suddenly started yelling at me.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.870
I wrote it off as her having
a few screws loose,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.170
Mizuhara Chizuru

A pure and refined

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.520
but it turned out that she was
actually a rental girlfriend.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.890
After a year of this, I tried to tell them

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.130
it was high time they dropped the act,
but it didn't go over so well.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.390
Well, a lot happened,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.440
but as his ex, I think I'll wait a little
longer and see what happens with them.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.750
Hi, hi!

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.330
I'm Sarashina Ruka, Kazuya-kun's girlfriend!

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.480
I was actually a rental girlfriend, too,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.810
but seeing how seriously Kazuya-kun
took these pretend relationships,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.180
I started getting the hots for him.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.960
While I do cross the line sometimes

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.360
and Chizuru-san may be a formidable rival,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.760
<i>I'm</i> the one who's Kazuya-kun's girlfriend.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.500
No matter what, I promise I'll
make him fall for me for sure!

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.480
Ah! Er...

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.120
I'm S-Sakurasawa Sumi.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.940
I started working as a rental
girlfriend to change myself

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.490
and learn how to talk to people better.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.990
I met Kazuya-kun when Chizuru-san
asked him to be my practice partner.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.220
I was just doing my job as a
rental girlfriend as always,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.110
but things happened, and I ended up being
introduced to his family as his girlfriend.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.480
And would you believe it, we go to the
same college and are next-door neighbors!

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.080
After that, I ended up running
into his ex at a pub,

fell off a ferry and into the sea,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.310

And just when I'd decided to
quit the rental girlfriend gig,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.760

It's okay! I wasn't expecting
anything from that, anyway!

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.370
What? But it's my ultimate technique!

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.180
<i>Mizuhara's amazing.</i>

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.650

breath for her every move...</i>

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.020

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.710
I-I didn't do a damned thing!

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.570

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:41.680

She's always on your mind.</i>

<i>She's incredible!</i>

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.420

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.980
Be careful, Your Highness.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.760
The enemy might yet be out there...

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.430
I shall suck out the poison now!

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.240
I gave my word...

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:32.430
I'll keep Tomoko-sama safe,
if it's the last thing I do...

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.920
Nene! Nene!

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.230

<i>Mizuhara put on a real show
right until the very end.</i>

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.040
<i>It could almost make one
believe she was the star.</i>

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.970
<i>It was clear to everybody there
who the MVP was that day.</i>

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.890
<i>Thank you for coming to watch the play today.</i>

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.100

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.220
Simply the best!

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.440
The audience loved you, and you
were Nene through and through!

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.130
I laughed so hard, my sides hurt.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.610

on an act on a daily basis...

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.830
Oh, you mean like method acting?

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.370
Uh, well, I guess.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.170
I bet you landed that other role.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.880
Oh, I don't know.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.130

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.660
Listen to yourself. I am a geezer.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.620
Looks like a done deal.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.010
Apparently, she's known him
since she was in grade school,

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.580

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.450
Oh, sorry. I'll call you.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:52.470
My agency says it'll lead to more
roles down the line if I deliver.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:57.100
And if I can make enough money as an

Oh, man.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.200

Well, I can't stop you from
buying a ticket and watching.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.690
But I've told very few people
that I'm pursuing acting.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.400
And considering my other clients,
you really shouldn't be...

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.550

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.170
I don't really know how to say it, but, uh...

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.130
I thought you were incredible!

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.930
Huh? What would you know about acting?

Oh, uh, no need to thank me.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.490
With this, you'll be free of me and can
focus on your acting career, right?

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:19.820
What are you talking about?

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.520
I mean, you'll be quitting the
rental girlfriend gig, right?

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.040
You said you would if this play went well
and you caught the director's eye...

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.860
Oh, that?

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.000

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.710
What?!

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.860
A different actress got the role.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.800
But why?

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.770
Because I don't have the talent.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.310
It is what it is.
Competition is fierce in showbiz.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.690
It doesn't matter how hard you work.
If you're not first, you're last.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.650
And Shiori-chan's super pretty, after all.
I'll just have to take this on the chin.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.350
Oh, but I might get another chance,

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.990
<i>I can't believe myself.</i>

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.250

But now I can't quit the rental

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.080
I'll need to keep working hard.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.040
<i>I can sense she's bottling it all up inside.</i>

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.540
I was actually staggering a little during
the fight scene. I should work on my core.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.510
<i>Deep down, she must be so upset,</i>

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.880
Maybe I didn't work out
as hard as I should have.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.490
<i>but she's trying to come to terms with it.</i>

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.510
<i>Compared to her, I'm such a...</i>

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.620
I guess I was the same as you.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.460
I kept telling you to be a man
and learn when to give up,

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.560
but I didn't know when to give up, either.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.890
I take the money I get from
playing the dreamy girlfriend,

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.440
and spend it on my own dream.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.400
A dream that will never come
true with my lack of talent.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.870
There are plenty of nineteen-year-old
actresses stealing the show out there.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.330
